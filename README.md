## Projects Overview üóÉÔ∏è  

### 1. AdventureWorks Bike Shop Dashboard  
**Description**:  
Developed an interactive dashboard for AdventureWorks Bike Shop to provide stakeholders with actionable insights across sales, marketing, supply chain, and customer retention strategies. The dashboard transitions from macro-level overviews (Executive Dashboard) to granular analytics (Product/Customer Details), enabling data-driven decision-making.  

**Tools & Skills Utilized**:  
- **Power BI**: Data modeling, DAX calculations, interactive visualizations.  
- **Key Features**: Drill-down capabilities, dynamic filters, and actual vs. target metrics comparison. 

**Key Insights**:  
- **Executive Dashboard**: Monitored overall revenue, profit, order volume, and return rates to inform strategic planning and risk management.  
- **Map Page**: Visualized total orders by continent to identify demand hotspots, and tailor regional marketing strategies.  
- **Product Detail Page**: Analyzed individual product performance (orders, revenue, profits, returns, return %) via an interactive area chart adjustable by year, month, week, or day. Enabled dynamic pricing analysis and issue diagnosis using gauges and line charts.  
- **Customer Detail Page**: Segmented customers by demographics and purchasing behavior to drive targeted marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and retention strategies.
